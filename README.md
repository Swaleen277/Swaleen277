### **End-to-End Azure Data Engineering Projects**

I have successfully completed **End-to-End Azure Data Engineering projects**, where I gained hands-on experience in designing, implementing, and optimizing data pipelines using **Azure's powerful suite of tools**. Below are the key highlights from my experience:

**Key Tools and Technologies Used:**
- **Azure Data Factory (ADF)**: For orchestrating and automating data workflows and pipelines.
- **Azure Databricks**: Used for data transformation leveraging **PySpark**.
- **Azure Synapse Analytics**: Implemented for data processing and creating external tables for efficiently querying data.
- **Azure SQL Database**: Used for storing structured data and integrating with other Azure services.
- **Delta Tables**: Implemented for efficient, scalable data storage and version control.
- **External File Formats**: Configured to manage data formats like Parquet and CSV for optimized data storage.
- **Power BI**: Established a connection between **Azure Synapse Analytics** and **Power BI** for visualizing and reporting data.

**Key Accomplishments:**
- Ingested and transformed data using **Azure Data Factory** and **Databricks** in a scalable and secure manner.
- Leveraged **PySpark** for data transformations and optimized large-scale data operations.
- Utilized **Azure Synapse Analytics** to store and process data, creating **external tables** for efficient querying of data stored in **Azure Data Lake**.
- Established a seamless connection between **Azure Synapse Analytics** and **Power BI** to enable dynamic, real-time dashboards and business intelligence reporting.

These projects have allowed me to refine my skills in **data engineering**, enabling me to work with large datasets, build scalable and secure pipelines, and gain practical experience in data transformation and visualization.
